        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The quality of content and the attractiveness of an environmental website can create an environmentally friendly attitude before one visits a secured area. This paper evaluates environmental websites using models like PROMETHEE II to understand their effectiveness and robustness in ranking and usability.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web transitioned from static, non-interactive Web 1.0 into dynamic Web 2.0 environments. This evolution has influenced how websites are designed and evaluated for impact and functionality.</p>

        <h2>Future Trends</h2>
        <p>The paper explores how semantic web technologies can help better structure unstructured data and how models like PROMETHEE II can offer scalable approaches for web evaluation and improvement.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Web applications are continually evolving, focusing on improving user engagement and managing unstructured data effectively. This paper highlights the significance of models like PROMETHEE II in these advancements.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            The structure of the webpage was designed using semantic HTML elements for clarity and readability. 
            The `<header>` tag contains the main title and publication details, ensuring the document's purpose is immediately clear. 
            The `<article>` tag is used to encapsulate the main content of the paper, providing a self-contained section. 
            Headings, such as `<h2>`, are used to divide the content into logical sections like Abstract and Introduction, making it easier to navigate. 
            Paragraphs are wrapped in `<p>` tags to maintain clean formatting and a professional appearance. 
            A `<footer>` is included at the bottom of the page, dynamically displaying the last modified date using JavaScript. 
            This ensures transparency and keeps the document up to date. Overall, the structure follows semantic web principles, enhancing accessibility, usability, and maintainability.
